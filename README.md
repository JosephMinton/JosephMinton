I’m actively building foundational knowledge and experiences in IT with a focus on labs and real world scenarios. My projects explore core concepts like Active Directory, ticketing systems, Microsoft 365, networking, system administration, and security fundamentals as I work toward my first IT role. This GitHub documents my learning process, problem-solving approach, and growth as I prepare to transition into information technology.
